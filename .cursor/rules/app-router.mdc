# Next.js Page and Route Rules
All new pages, layouts, and API routes must:
- Use the App Router convention.
- Be placed under the `app/` directory.
- Be Server Components by default, unless client-side interactivity is required. Use "use client" only when necessary.
- Use named exports for components, not default exports.
